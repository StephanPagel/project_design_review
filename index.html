            We will review your designs (website or mobile/web app) and explore where the design works well and where it
            can be improved. We focus our process around one central question: “What can we do to make this design more
            efficient?”

                        Unlike any other design review or audit, we will not only tell you what can be improved but also
                        make revamps to the most critical parts of the design.

                        We will evaluate your design based on a variety of parameters and provide a detailed visual
                        report with useful tips and design hacks. This would be the starting point for further work on
                        the design.

                    <p>
                        We provide several strategies for further redesign by various contractors, from freelancers to
                        high-end agencies. We provide you with an assessment of the timing and cost for both a full
                        redesign and quick but effective improvements.
